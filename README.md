# Expo Starter

A minimal [Expo](https://expo.dev) starter template with Expo Router and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

To run your Expo app locally, install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open the app on your device using the Expo Go app, or press `w` to open in web browser.

## Development

This template includes:

- **Expo Router** for file-based routing
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **React Native** components ready to use

Edit files in the `app/` directory to start building your application.
